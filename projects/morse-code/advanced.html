    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In our <a href="./">basic Morse code project</a> we had to translate the Morse code we recieved ourselves. Using <code>arrays</code> to store lists of all the Morse codes we can get the Microbit to translate the code for us. We can also use these lists to check that the Morse code we enter to send is correct before we send a letter.</p>

    <p>To read a value from an array we use

    <p>This has all the code from the <a href="./">basic Morse code project</a> and two <code>array</code> lists for the morse codes and all the letters of the alphabet. They have already been filled in for you.</p>
