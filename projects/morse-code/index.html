<div class="project-info">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before telephones and the internet, the quickest way to send messages was by telegraph. This was a network of wires suspended on telegraph poles on land and thick rubber cables under the sea. Messages could be sent as electrical pulses at very high speed.</p>
    <p>Samuel Morse invented a code that represents letters as sets of short and long electrical pulses, known as 'dots' (.) and 'dashes'(-). In Morse code A is .- B is -... between each letter is a short pause and a longer pause between each word. Telegraph operators could send and recieve messages very quickly by listening to these electical pulses as beeps and tapping their reply with a button.</p>
    <p>We are going to program our Microbit to work like a telegram using Morse code. Then we can be telegraph operators and swap messages with other Microbits.</p> 
    <p>In our code we will use <code>text</code> to store dots and dashes` and the <code>radio</code> to send the code to another Microbit</p> 
</div>
<div class="project-steps">
    <h3>Dots and Dashes</h3>
    <p>We are going to enter a dot by pressing the A button and a dash by pressing B. Each letter can have between one and five dots and dashes, we will store these in a <code>text</code> variable called <code>letterToSend</code>.
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Start a new, empty project at <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org" target="_blank">makecode.microbit.org</a> and rename your project "Morse code"</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Make a new variable called <code>LetterToSend</code></p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>In the <code>Start loop</code> add a <code>set</code> block from the Variables draw and change it to <code>LetterToSend</code>.</p>
    <p>Add and empty text block from the Advanced, Text drawer.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps">
    <p>Now we have a variable to store our Morse code and we have set it to be empty we can use it to store button presses by the telegraph operator. Each time a button is pressed we will use the Text block <code>join</code> to add the code to our <code>LetterToSend</code> variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add an <code>on button A pressed</code> block from Input.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add a <code>set</code> block from Variables and change it to <code>LetterToSend</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add a <code>join</code> block from Text</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>In the top of the <code>join</code> block and a copy of <code>LetterToSend</code> from Variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add an empty text block from the Text drawer to the bottom of the <code>join</code> block.</p>
    <p>Set it to .</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add a <code>show string</code> block from Basic</p>
    <p>Set it to <code>LetterToSend</code> to show all the dots and dashes we have entered so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Duplicate this code, changing the button press to B and the . to -</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps">
    <h3>Sending a letter</h3>
    <p>We can enter letters in Morse code using the A and B buttons, to send them we will use A+B using <code>radio</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add a <code>radio set group</code> block from Radio to the <code>on start</code> block.</p>
    <p>Set this to your group number</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add an <code>on button A+B pressed</code> block from Input.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add a <code>radio send string</code> block from Radio, set it to <code>LetterToSend</code></p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Reset the <code>LetterToSend</code> variable with an empty text block ready for the next letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps">
    <h3>Receiving a letter</h3>
    <p>When we receive a letter we will show the Morse code on the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Add an <code>on radio recieved recievedString</code> block from Radio.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Set a <code>show string</code> block from Basic to show <code>recievedString</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps">
    <p>We might be in the middle of trying to send a letter ourselves when we recieve one. This can get confusing, so if we recieve a letter while we are trying to send one we'll delete the code we have entered so far in <code>LetterToSend</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>Set <code>LetterToSend</code> to an empty text block from Advanced, Text.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps">
    <p>We now have a working telegraph system that can send and recieve Morse code. Try sending a message to your partner and get them to send one back.</p>
    <p>Can you think of a way to tell each other when it's their turn to send a message?</p>
    <p>This works as a telegraph, in the <a href="./advanced.html">advanced section</a> of this project we make a version that translates recieved Morse code into letters using an <code>array</code>.</p>
