    <h3>Make a simple game with a Zip Halo</h3>
    <p>A Zip Halo is a ring of 24 lights that can be programmed to be any colour we like. In this project we will use the top half of the light ring to make a juggling game. Pressing the A and B buttons will be how the player juggles the ball.</p>

       <h3>Arrays</h3>
       <p>There are twenty four lights or ‘pixels’ on our rings, in code we start counting at zero so the lights are numbered 0,1,2,3...23. We will only be using the top ones, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. To help us keep track of the lights we are using we will use a new block called an array. An array is a variable that can hold a list instead of just one thing.</p>

    <p>Open this link to find today’s code. </p>
 
    <p>This code already has a variable called pixel_number set to a ‘create array with’ block. We are going to use this to make a list of the pixels we need for our game in the order they are on the zip halo. </p>
</div>
<div class="project-steps__step">
    <p>We want to list all the pixels on the top of the board, starting with the one on the left and working round to the one on the right.</p>
    <p>Fill in the rest of the numbers in the array. Remember that we start counting at zero in code, but the numbers printed on the board start at
    <p>one. So we will call the pixel labelled one as 0,  the one labelled 2 as 1 the last pixel labelled 24 will be 23 in our code.</p>
    <p>You should end up with an array that looks like this.</p>
