<div class="project-info">
    <h2>Introduction</h2><p>This project uses two microbits to control a robot remotely using the radio blocks. The remote controller will send our instructions to the robot, the robot board will receive these instructions and control the robot's motors.</p>
    <p>We will use the <code>radio</code> and <code>accelerometer</code>.</p>
    <p>For this project you will need a two wheeled robot designed for the microbit. Kits are available such as this <a href="https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5604-line-following-buggy-for-the-bbc-microbit.html">line following buggy.</a> Or you can <a href="https://github.com/huffeec/minimum-viable-robot">download plans</a> and make your own simple two wheeled robot, or find a makerspace, like <a href="https://doesliverpool.com">DoES Liverpool</a>, and design your own.</p>
<p>The instructions for this project are in two parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./remote-controller">Remote controller</a> - Sends information from the<code>accelerometer</code> by <code>radio</code></li>
<li><a href="./robot-board">Robot board</a> - Receives instructions by <code>radio</code> and drives the robot's motors</li>
</ul>
